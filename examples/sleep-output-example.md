# Example Sleep Consolidation Output

This is what a typical nightly sleep consolidation looks like when it runs and
announces to your channel:

---

🌙 **Sleep Consolidation Complete — 2026-01-15**

- **HIPPOCAMPUS updated**: Shifted focus from completed "memory system build" → "API integration". Removed 2 resolved pins (auth bug fixed, deploy complete). Added new pin for rate limit issue.
- **Daily notes compressed**: Removed ~1.5KB of verbose tool output from today's notes (details already in docs/).
- **Pattern noted**: Third time this week hitting context limits during long debugging sessions. Consider lowering flush threshold to 55%.
- **Promoted to MEMORY.md**: "Always write structured error logs — grep-friendly format saves 5 min per debug session."
- **Pruned**: 3 stale HIPPOCAMPUS pins (>48h, unreferenced). Archived completed project summary to docs/project-archive.md.
- **All files within budget**: HIPPOCAMPUS 720B, MEMORY 3.2KB.
- **Committed and pushed** to git.
